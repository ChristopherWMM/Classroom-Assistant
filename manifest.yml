  long_description: Classroom Assistant is a publicly distributable Slack
    application that can intelligently answer student questions in the place of
    an instructor or TA. The application creates a personalized knowledge base
    per Slack workspace and learns based on information and answers provided by
    the instructor. This is meant to provide an automated solution for
    instructors to only need to answer a question once.
